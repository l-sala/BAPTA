In the demo_data folder there are two folders:
* paced
	* gp_paced
	* hiPSC-CM_paced
	* rat_paced_1Hz
* spontaneous
	* mouse.san_spontaneous

To run the analysis:

1. create a folder name `data` in the main directory.
2. copy one or more folders inside (e.g. gp_paced). Just make sure the data have been acquired either in paced or spontaneous configurations.
3. run the analysis.
